\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment our focus was to study two Methods (Nodal Method and Meshes Method) in order to compare the results calculated by these methods (theoretical results) to the given ones by our circuit simulator (simulator results). By comparing them we can see that something clearly went wrong, our results are in no way similar to the simulation. Most likely due to the octave calculations,
